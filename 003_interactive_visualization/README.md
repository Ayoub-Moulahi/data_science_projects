# Data Visualization Project:

## Overview

This project is designed to enhance my data visualization skills using folium and plotly. It consists of two subprojects, each serving a specific purpose. The first subproject focuses making map plots with folium , while the second  is dedicated to creating a dashboard using plotly.

## Project Goals

- Improve proficiency in data cleaning and preparation techniques.
- Gain expertise in creating informative and visually appealing data visualizations.
- Explore real-world datasets and extract meaningful insights through visualization.
- Enhance understanding of folium and plotly for data visualization.

## Project Components
### 1. folium_maps:
#### ### Notebook : folium_map

In this notebook, I focus on creating compelling visualizations:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics.
- Utilizing plotly  for plotting.

### 2. plotly_dashboard 
#### Notebook 1: Data Wrangling
In this notebook, I perform the following tasks:
- Data collection and import.
- Data cleaning, including handling missing values and outliers.
- Data transformation.

#### Notebook 2: Data Visualization

In this notebook, I focus on creating compelling visualizations:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics.
- Utilizing plotly and its derivatives for plotting.
- Designing a variety of charts, including maps, line graphs, pie plots, and more.
- Adding informative titles, labels, and legends to the visualizations.


## Dataset
### 1. folium_maps: (same data used in previous project)
- The project uses real-world data related to incidents of crime in the City of Los Angeles dating back to 2020.

### 2. plotly dashboard:
- Male population by single age. De facto population as of 1 July of the year indicated classified by single age (0, 1, 2, ..., 99, 100+). Data are presented in thousands.
- Female population by single age. De facto population as of 1 July of the year indicated classified by single age (0, 1, 2, ..., 99, 100+). Data are presented in thousands.
