# Data Visualization Project:

## Overview

This project is designed to enhance my data visualization skills using Matplotlib and its derivatives. It consists of two Jupyter Notebooks, each serving a specific purpose. The first notebook focuses on data wrangling and preprocessing, while the second notebook is dedicated to data visualization.

## Project Goals

- Improve proficiency in data cleaning and preparation techniques.
- Gain expertise in creating informative and visually appealing data visualizations.
- Explore real-world datasets and extract meaningful insights through visualization.
- Enhance understanding of Matplotlib and its related libraries for data visualization.

## Project Components

### Notebook 1: Data Wrangling

In this notebook, I perform the following tasks:
- Data collection and import.
- Data cleaning, including handling missing values and outliers.
- Feature engineering, if necessary.
- Data transformation and normalization.

### Notebook 2: Data Visualization

In this notebook, I focus on creating compelling visualizations:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics.
- Utilizing Matplotlib and its derivatives for plotting.
- Designing a variety of charts, including bar plots, line graphs, scatter plots, and more.
- Adding informative titles, labels, and legends to the visualizations.


## Dataset

- The project uses real-world data related to incidents of crime in the City of Los Angeles dating back to 2020.
